# Mid Term Reveiw


## What whent well (Strengths)

* I feel I am confident and dont mind speaking infront of an audience which makes it easier for me to ask questions and ask for help where needed

* I feel i have understood the development and testing lifecycles which make it easier to see how tests are done and why they are done in a certain way. 

* I have also learnt and understood why documentation is so vital. 

* Having done a presentation online it has given me an understanding on how to present well online and also watching others has given me an insight to what a good presentation looks like.

* Learnt the benefits of both Jest and Selenium and i feel i understand the basics.

* Being able to help others.

* Being able to get help when ive been struggling. 


## What could have been better (Weaknesses)

* I feel in the first couple of weeks i could have done alot more than i did during Personal development time. Only on the 3rd week i actually looked at ISTQB and started doing mock tests. Had i started this earlier i would have been more confident with the definitions and I would have done alot better on the weekly quiz. 

* The first week in ROQ induction could have been more interactive rather than Presentations.

* Could do more team projects (although we have done a few - and i know more are to come) to get us used to working in teams.

* When doing practicles if something is working I need to try and solve the issue myself before going to ask. Use the rule "3 before me"

* although I have been going over things which we have covered I feel I could do alot more.


## What skills have i developed 

* I have developed my programing skill. Prior to starting the bootcamp i had very limited knowledge and within 6 weeks i feel comfortable and confident to go away and write my own HTML, CSS, JavaScript.

* Presentaion Skills 

* Communication skills bot in person and online

* Have a positive look on everything.


## Disadvantags of working from home

* Can get sidetracked very easily especially when others are working from home. 

* can get a bit qoverwhelming as its not as easy to talk to someone.

* Im more reluctant to ask questions and have a converstion online. 


## What do i need to work on to better my self

* research more into Selenium so that i am able to create more complex tests, as at the moment i am creating simple tests.

* Go over the ISTQB glossary more to get used to the wordings of the defenitions.

* Do more mock tests so that i am confident when it comes to carrying out the exam.

* Learn to set goals which then make you push yourself to learning new things to ensure to meet those goals. 

* Research into different languages which we havent covered so that I have aot of knowledge of different languages. 

* Constatntly go over what we have done to ensure i dont forget anything and also to ensue i am confident in what i am doing.
* * DOM stuff
* * Jest
* * Testing principles
